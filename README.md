# Catch the Dot 

**Catch the Dot** is a small interactive game where you use your **index finger** to touch red dots on your screen â€” all detected through your **webcam**. It uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for finger tracking and gameplay interaction.

## How to Play

You can start the game using the `main.py` script with one of two modes:

### Singleplayer
```bash
python main.py singleplayer
```
Catch as many red dots as you can using one index finger.

### Multiplayer
```bash
python main.py multiplayer
```
Compete between your **left and right hands**. Each hand tries to catch more dots than the other.
